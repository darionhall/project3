<B> USER STORIES </B>

* Getting a haircut you like every time.
* I want a haircut I had in the past.
* My barber/stylist moved.
* I moved to a new city (i.e. I went away to college, summer vacation, retired to Florida...etc).
* I need a haircut while on vacation.
* When my barber/stylist and I communicate, we're never on the same page.
* I would like my hair appointment to fit in my schedule without throwing it off course.


<B> OBJECTIVE </B>

The Style.Up application allows you to conveniently track your haircut and hairstyle history. Being able to show stylists and barbers exactly what you want eases communication and increases user satisfaction.


<b> FEATURES </b>

* Find a local salon using Yelp, pinpoint it's address, and receive directions should you need them.
* Upload a picture to visually reference each haircut or hairstyle.
* Share styles by clicking on the specific hairstyle, filling out the email form and pressing the email button to send it.


<B> CONFIGURATION </B>
